'''
String is a text based data type .
In Python, strings are immutable. Once a string is created, its content cannot be changed. 
If you want to modify a string, you'll need to create a new one
This immutability provides certain advantages, including improved safety and simplicity in string handling.
It ensures that once a string is created, its content remains unchanged, preventing unintentional modifications. 
However, if you frequently need to modify a string, using a mutable data structure like a list and converting it back to a string might be a more suitable approach
'''
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)
# Note: in the result, the line breaks are inserted at the same position as in the code.
